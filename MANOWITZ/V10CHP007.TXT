League Engineers

The mysterious and unnerving Guild of Engineers are in control of all things technical and scientific. Not only are their scientific ways viewed with suspicion but their taste for cyber implants also puts them beyond decency and sacrilegious in the opinions of serfs and devout church priests. Yet it started as a religious order itself and some members maintain a faith that combines experimental science with rare theological concepts.
