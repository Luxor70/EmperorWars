Incarnates

A heretical schism of the Universal Church of the Celestial Sun.

The origins of the Incarnate religion originate in a liberal sect of the Universal Church in the Second Republic era called Eurygnostics, who preached the Universal Heterodoxy, which stated that sentients as well as the Pancreator had a spark of the Holy Flame; and also taught that Church laity as well as clergy could study and interpret the Omega Gospels for themselves. The Eurygnostics also were willing to mix religion and politics.
