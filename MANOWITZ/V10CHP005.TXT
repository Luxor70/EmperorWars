Etyri Air Commando

While not as beautiful colored as other Etyri, these majestic soldiers inspire awe with their wide wingspans and graceful air maneuvers. They wear leather harnesses hung with weapons and tools. Their family symbols are emblazoned on their breasts. Wing leaders sometimes have energy shields.

Decados-only unit.
