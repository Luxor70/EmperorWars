Pentateuch

Terraformed by the legendary Doramus, Pentateuch is considered by many to be a magical planet, the ultimate wedding of magic and technology. There seems strong evidence that Doramus deliberately designed the terraforming to create ley lines and energy centers, although most of these are little understood today, for Doramus left no records of his secrets. The Eskatonic Order claims the cathedral and rulership of this world, although the planet is a frequent target for Inquisitorial scrutiny.
