Sky Tear

Sky Tear is a Lost World, a planet that has been cut off from the Jumproutes of the Known Worlds. The no-mans land between the Vuldrok Star-Nations and the Kurgan Caliphate. The strange, fungus infested world of Sky Tear is protected by both Vuldrok and Kurgans for its sacred and important muazi flesh.

All human inhabitants of Sky Tear become insane after some time due to infection from the native flora.
