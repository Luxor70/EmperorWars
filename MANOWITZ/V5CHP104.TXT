Space Fighter

Space fighters are usually smaller than capital ships and are designed to be highly maneuverable. They are sleek and agile craft, capable of executing tight turns and evasive maneuvers during combat.

Space fighters typically have a variety of offensive weapons, including lasers, missiles, torpedoes, or energy-based weaponry. They may also have defensive measures like shields or point defense systems to counter incoming enemy fire.
