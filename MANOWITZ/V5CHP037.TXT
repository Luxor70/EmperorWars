Cybercorps

The Cybercorps is typically composed of individuals who have undergone cybernetic enhancements, either voluntarily or as a result of injury or necessity. These enhancements can range from prosthetic limbs and sensory augmentations to more advanced neural implants and interface systems. The members of the Cybercorps may have expertise in cybernetic technology, maintenance, and combat applications.

Members of the Cybercorps might possess unique abilities and skills granted by their cybernetic enhancements, such as increased strength, enhanced reflexes, or specialized interfaces that allow them to interact with technology or computer systems directly. They may be trained in combat, espionage, or other specialized roles that take advantage of their cybernetic capabilities.
