Vera Cruz

Long known as one of the most beautiful planets in space, this Hazat world bears the stamp of the great terraformer Doramos, whose wife is said to have come from here. Some of the wealthiest people in the Empire like to come here to escape their concerns and worries, and Vera Cruz has the least military influence of any Hazat world. Still, many older Hazat retire here (or get retired here), and they still do their best to keep their hands in the intrigues which plague the Known-Worlds.
