Aylon

Ruled now by the al-Malik. Aylon was once owned by the Ur-Ukar. It is famed for being the first planet the Prophet set foot upon after his miraculous vision (gained on a Lost World beyond Aylon's borders); Pilgrims come from all over annually to see the spot where the Prophet first preached. The rest of the planet is taken up by large reserves, and the al-Malik make a lot of money catering to the interests of off-world hunters and recreationalists.
