Ur-Ukar

The other race recognised as Children of the Ur. They hold a close relationship to the Anunnaki known as the Kadani, whom they revere as gods. Displaced from the Obun homeworld after the war in the heavens the Ukari are tribalistic and clannish and have become accustomed to living underground or in the dark.
