Absolution

This world has been compromised by the Symbiots. It is outside of the Stigmata Garrison's direct influence, and the people of Absolution have been abandoned by the Known Worlds. Do people still even exist on this planet? Or are they all Symbiots now? Travel to Absolution (and to all compromised worlds)is forbidden. Any ship caught trying to enter the Known Worlds from these planets is destroyed by the Stigmata Garrison.
