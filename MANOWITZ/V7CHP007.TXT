Eridol

Eridol is a Lost World, a planet that has been cut off from the Jumproutes of the Known Worlds. This Lost World is inhabited by some of the most primitive branches of humanity. The planet is largely water with some archipelagos. It is the lost home world of House Thana. The Vuldroks occasionally raid the planet.
