Rook Operatives

The Rooks are the intelligence arm of House Hawkwood , concerned primarily with collecting information on the other Royal Houses and the Vuldrok Star Nation. Looked down upon by the other intelligence agencies due to their reputation for not blending in quite as well as they should.

Hawkwood-only unit.
