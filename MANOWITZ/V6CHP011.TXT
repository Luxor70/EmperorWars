Criticorum

No al-Malik would ever deny this planet's value, nor would they deny the extreme problems it has caused the house. Once considered for the capital of the Second Republic, it has jumproutes to seven other worlds, and travelers from Byzantium Secundus, the Church worlds, the al-Malik planets, the Decados hegemony, the Li Halan worlds and Ukar regularly stop there. The League has also established a substantial presence here, and the guilds maintain a number of vehicle and weapons plants. As a result, the world hosts legions of ambitious schemers and spies from around the Known Worlds. Intrigues here may lack the subtlety of those on Byzantium Secundus, but they are at least as common.
