Misfits Guild

While existence of these genetically-engineered beings is usually hidden, they are occasionally caught and brought to the authorities to answer for their tainted genes.

Misfits jobs are handled by a procurer. Some procurers specialize in military units, and spend time molding a rag-tag group of freaks into a cohesive unit where each member's power adds to the whole. Such a cadre is known as a Mongrel Squad.
