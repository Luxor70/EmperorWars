Hover Flak

Hover Flak is a term that combines the concept of a hovering platform with the function of a flak weapon system. Flak, short for "fliegerabwehrkanone" (German for "anti-aircraft cannon"), refers to anti-aircraft artillery designed to engage and destroy enemy aircraft or aerial targets.

The primary function of a hover flak is to engage and neutralize airborne threats. It would be equipped with anti-aircraft weaponry, such as rapid-fire cannons, guided missiles, or other specialized anti-aircraft munitions designed to engage and destroy enemy aircraft.
