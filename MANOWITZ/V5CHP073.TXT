Light Carrier

Light Carriers are typically smaller in size compared to their larger counterparts, such as heavy carriers or capital ships. They have a more limited carrying capacity for strike craft, usually accommodating a smaller number of fighters or other support vessels.

Light Carriers focus on deploying and coordinating the operations of fighter squadrons. They have well-equipped hangar bays and launch systems to deploy and recover their fighter complement efficiently.
