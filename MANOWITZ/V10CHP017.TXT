Gannok

Considered barely sentient primates at first, the gannok surprised xenologists when they suddenly exhibited human speech after only a short period of contact.

Quickly becoming a curiosity all over the Second Republic, the gannok were proven to possess a fascinating degree of adaptability to technology that far surpassed their previous primitive tools.

They are known for their mechanical aptitude.
