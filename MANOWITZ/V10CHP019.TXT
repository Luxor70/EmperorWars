Vau Mercenary

We believe the Vau are related to amphibians or reptiles. Their leathery skin resembles that of the Hironem, although their bone structure is quite different. Their legs suggest descent from a fleet-footed animal, although whether this was a predator, herd beast or scavenger is unknown. Too much time exists between the present Vau and their distant ancestors to draw any conclusions as to their evolution of consciousness and current culture.
