Hidden Martyrs

A highly efficient network of informants and agents originally established by Cardano to ensure the house never fell into sin again, the Hidden Martyrs are quite feared on the Garden Worlds, but have proven somewhat ineffective when ordered, as they have occasionally been, to infiltrate or act against foreign groups. Their counterintelligence abilities, however, are frighteningly strong, rivaling those of the Jakovian Agency in some areas.
