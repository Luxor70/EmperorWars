The Dispossessed

The Dispossessed is an army of masterless ronin who escaped the annihilation of their Chauki masters in the Hazat purge of that royal house, still existing as a vagabond army. Disgraced by its inability to protect its original employers, the small army has carried its wounded honor through generations of new recruits, offering its services for pay, but also maintaining a strict ethical code.

Unfriendly with Hazat House.
