Archons of the Hazat Claw

Originally the internal security police of the Justus line, the Archons have become a significant intelligence agency within House Hazat. The Archons are involved as much in ensuring internal harmony in the fractious house as in external intelligence-gathering operations.

Hazat-only unit.
