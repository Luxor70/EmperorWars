Holy Terra

Also known by its old name, Urth. It is the capital of the Church and the cradle of humanity. But the planet is overcrowded: teeming masses of the faithful crowd into the cities that dot the globe. Immigration is strictly controlled by the Church, and those born on Holy Terra are given special consideration over foreigners. It is the prime planet for pilgrimages, however, as holy sites important to human history are found on every continent.
