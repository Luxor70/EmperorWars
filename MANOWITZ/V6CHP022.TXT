Kordeth

This harsh planet is home to the Ukari, though the planet is jointly owned by the Merchant League and House al-Malik. Most of the planet has an unbreathable atmosphere, though near the north and south poles the air is breathable. Most clans of Ukari on Kordeth live underground, and the clans are divided into the human-aligned Allied Clans and clans of anti-human Ukari. Most of the human population lives in domed cities on Kordeth's surface.
