Starbase

A starbase is a facility located in outer space that serves as key location for various activities, including space exploration, trade, and military operations.

Starbases are typically situated at strategic points in space, such as near important trade routes, resource-rich areas, or in proximity to contested regions. They provide a central hub for operations and serve as a staging point for various activities.
