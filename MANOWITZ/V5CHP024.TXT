Brother Battle seek out and defend the holy Empire from threats that would seek to destroy its sanctimony. Most Brother Battle train in their military devotions since before the age of ten, sometimes when left on the doorstep of the monastery.

Originally a band of faithful fighters who swore to keep open the route to Yathrib and Aylon, they now guard the interests of the Church. Although the order was initiated to protect pilgrims and pursue heretics, the order is now charted by noble houses, Church sects and even guilds to perform elite military operations on many worlds, including the deadly Stigmata Front against the Symbiot alien invaders.
