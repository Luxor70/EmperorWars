PTS Laser Canon

A planetary defense laser cannon is a large-scale weapon system designed to defend a planet against threats such as incoming projectiles, spacecraft, or other hostile forces.

They are massive structures, located on the surface of a planet. They require a substantial footprint and infrastructure to support their operation. These cannons would employ advanced laser technology capable of emitting highly concentrated beams of energy. The lasers would be powerful enough to cause significant damage to incoming threats, potentially disabling or destroying them.

Planetary defense laser cannons would have an extended effective range, enabling them to engage targets at great distances. This range would allow them to intercept threats before they reach critical areas or population centers.
