STING

The Hazat military intelligence service, STING is skilled at quick and paramilitary covert operations but lacks significant counterintelligence or long-term intelligence gathering capacities. These functions have been performed by STING in the past, but it has had a poor track record with this type of work. The rise of the Eduardo line to the crown has led STING to leave such operations to the Archons, though this has been resisted by some within STING.

Hazat-only unit.
