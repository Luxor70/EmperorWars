Chernobog

The Symbiot homeworld. Little is known of Chernobog, for the last humans to set foot upon the world never returned. The jumpgate to Chernobog from Stigmata is blockaded; noone is allowed in or out, although the occasional Symbiot force breaks through nonetheless. It is said that the planet is a steamy jungle teeming with Symbiot lifeforms of all kinds, fighting each other tooth and claw for dominance.
