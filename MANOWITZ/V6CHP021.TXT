Kish

Homeworld of the Li Halan, Kish is an extremely conservative desert planet. The residents consider the relative chaos of surrounding worlds to be proof that the Li Halan are the only rulers worthy of the title. Outsiders claim that there are more peasant uprisings on Kish than the Li Halan admit to.
