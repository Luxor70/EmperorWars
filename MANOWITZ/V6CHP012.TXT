Daishan

Compromised in the Symbiot War, Daishan was scorched by the Stigmata Garrison. Symbiots cannot grow anything on scorched worlds, but neither can humans. The planet seems to have been deserted by the once-prevalent Symbiot forces, but the Imperial army is not stupid -they know Symbiot seeds surely lay waiting to burst forth tendrils of new horrors. But there may also be a clue to beating back the monsters, and for such a clue, the faithful will risk all.
