Apshai

A joint human and Vau world. Apshai has many citizens of the Empire living upon it, and the Vau rarely leave the one continent they forbid humans to enter, where the G'nesh also live. Human colonization of Apshai was allowed during the Second Republic, a secondary result of years of diplomatic negotiations concerning an affair long since forgotten (surely the Vau remember, but they do not speak of the incident). Empire spies are sent here to observe the Vau, but they are never allowed close enough to see anything of worth. A "mission to Apshai" is equivalent to a vacation or retirement.
