Frost

Frost is a Lost World, a planet that has been cut off from the Jumproutes of the Known Worlds. This notoriously freezing world is a core Vuldrok planet. It was once dominant in Vuldrok life but has been held back by its belligerent Thanes. Piracy remains a popular activity on this resource poor world as it was when it was first colonised.
