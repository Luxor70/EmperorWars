Pyre

Home to the famous Burning Desert, a hot-house hell that proved unterraformable, this world is claimed by Temple Avesti, which is allowed to rule it in the name of the Patriarch. The sect's main monastery lies in the harsh desert, but there is little tech to aid the monks in surviving the heat. Most are forced to relocate to the milder habitats by the sea. The planet is considered inquisitor central, but most Avestite Inquisitors leave the system to look for sin elsewhere, never suspecting it might reside on their homeworld. As a matter of fact, at least one secret laboratory operates on the southern continent, far from the eyes and attention of the monks, who do not have the facilities to monitor all space traffic to and from the world.
