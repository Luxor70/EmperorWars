Artemis

Home to the head Sanctuary Aeon monastery, Artemis is a holy world with strict immigration policies. While nobles and guildmembers live on Artemis, they must follow Church law, which imposes strict behavioral rules. Every law is designed to minimize conflict, including such penalties as exile to far continents if the two parties cannot govern their relationships with each other. Despite the seemingly harsh rules, the best medical technology in the Empire is found here. The sick and dying who can afford the journey to Artemis for healing usually return whole again (although with a Samaritan penance they must perform as payment).
