Avestites

These fanatics are held on a tight leash by the Orthodoxy who are often too regressive for the Patriarch's tastes. Of any group none command such fear and awe as the Avestites who are synonymous with the Inquisition, ever seeking out signs of blasphemy and sin in order to save humanity from their own hubris.
