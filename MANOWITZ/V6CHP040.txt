Vau

A closed world; nobody is allowed intoVau Space without diplomatic permission. They rarely kill invaders, though. They simply snatch them up with their plasmanets and deposit them back on their side of the border. Repeated attempts to enter, however, may be met with deadly force. This said, blackmarket trade does take place between the nations, but mainly in Human Space, on worlds such as Manitou or Vril-Ya Vau is home to the mandarins who venture into Human Space on missions for their leaders. It is rumored that one of the Vau leaders is placed on this world, sent from one of the many Vau worlds beyond the planet's border.
