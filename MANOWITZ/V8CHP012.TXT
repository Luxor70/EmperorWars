Vorox

At an average of 12 feet tall, covered in shaggy fur, a lupin shaped head and four muscular arms ending in highly venomous claws it's no wonder that Vorox are considered the most ferocious sentient in the Known Worlds. However the church recognises them as having a soul closest to that of humanity. The distinction lies between the feral Vorox and those who have been civilised.
