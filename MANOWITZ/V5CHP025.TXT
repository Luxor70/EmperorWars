Bulk Hauler

The Bulk Hauler is a spacecraft used for transporting large quantities of cargo across interstellar distances.

It is primarily designed for cargo transportation rather than combat or exploration. It typically features a massive cargo hold or holds to accommodate vast amounts of goods, resources, or materials. The ship's design prioritizes efficient storage and transportation capabilities, with less emphasis on luxury or speed.
