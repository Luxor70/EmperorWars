Twilight

Lost World with jumproutes to Antioch and Ravenna. A gloomy, subterranean world, Twilight is a technologically advanced, but ruined world, shattered in the aftermath of a nuclear war, split among rival factions of tyrants, plutocrats, and nobles. Descendents of the Hawkwoods, the Heidgard Clan noble house follows the same creed of honor and duty as Hawkwood is still renowned for, and has strong ties with the planet's diminished Ur-Obun populace.
