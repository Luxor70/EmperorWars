Raven

Raven is a mystical planet in the Vuldrok empire. Its geography is landscaped by the Annunuki leaving it with mist covered mountains and a yellow soil. It is warm enough to support a large amount of agriculture.

Ur ruins exist in places across the land and the planet is a great source of Vuldrok runes.
