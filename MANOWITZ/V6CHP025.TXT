Madoc

This aquatic world is a rich resource for the League. The vast majority of the surface is covered by water, and the marine life is varied and wondrous, producing many delicacies. However, this cuisine is hard to ship offworld, so the rich who desire it must come to Madoc. Rumors persist of a sentient race living in the oceans, but no definitive proof has been discovered. This is one of the rare worlds which required little terraforming, and is said to hold many undespoiled secrets beneath its waves.
