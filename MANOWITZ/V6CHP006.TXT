Bannockburn

The headquarters of the Muster, who coordinate their efforts against both the Symbiots and the Vuldrok raiders from this planet. It is also the homeworld of the Gannok, devilishly clever tricksters with a penchant for invention and high-tech jury-rigging. Most of the inhabited sections of the planet are rugged and craggy highlands with broad moors. Strange Ur ruins can be found in various places, most long since stripped of their valuable artifacts.
