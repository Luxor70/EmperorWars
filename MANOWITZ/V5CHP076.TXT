Marauder

These space legionnaires have the reputation as some of the craziest warriors in existence. They send themselves hurtling out of airlocks at enemy ships, hoping that they accurately lined themselves up with their targets. If not, they drift helplessly until (if) one of their ships comes to retrieve them.
