Gwynneth

Gwynneth has suffered the worst of late from the Vuldrok Raiders'invasions. It is believed to be only a matter of time before the Vuldrok set up a permanent base in the forested wilderness, hidden from easy scrutiny. The Hawkwood rulers fear that the long-defiant pagan peoples living in the woods would welcome the Raiders.
