Ur-Ukar Dark Legion

Along with the Ur-Obun, the Ur-Ukar are one of the two races recognised as Children of the Ur. They hold a close relationship to the Anunnaki whom they revere as gods. Displaced from the Obun homeworld after the War in the Heavens, they were placed on Kordeth. Ukari are tribalistic and clannish and have become physically accustomed to living underground and in the dark.
