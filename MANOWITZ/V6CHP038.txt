Tethys

An Imperial world, once run by an independent guild but now owned by the Imperial Fleet. This is one of the oldest worlds in Human Space, and was stripped of its resources long ago. It now survives by attracting renowned craftsmen and manufacturers, promising land and low noble status in return for a cut of their profits. One of the remote continents on a nearby planet in the system is said to be used by the Imperial Fleet for training and war games; entry onto this planet is closely guarded.
