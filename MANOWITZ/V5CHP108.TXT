Stealth Bomber

A stealth bomber, also known as a stealth strike aircraft, is a type of military aircraft designed to minimize its radar signature and reduce its visibility to enemy air defenses. These bombers are specifically engineered to penetrate hostile territory, deliver a payload of munitions, and evade detection and interception.
