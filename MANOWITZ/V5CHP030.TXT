Cloaking Corvette

A Cloaking Corvette is a spacecraft that is equipped with advanced technology to achieve stealth and cloaking capabilities.

It is designed to evade detection by enemy sensors, making it difficult for other vessels or installations to spot or track it. This is typically achieved through the use of advanced stealth systems, energy manipulation, or cloaking devices that render the ship virtually invisible or significantly reduce its signature. These technologies can conceal the ship from both visual and electronic detection methods, allowing it to move undetected or launch surprise attacks.
