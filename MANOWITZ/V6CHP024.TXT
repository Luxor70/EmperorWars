Leminkainen

A Hawkwood-ruled border world which suffered heavily from the barbarian invasions of the past. In 4525, barbarians invaded (the Vuldrok), using bioweapons that killed a third of the population. Bouts of plague still surface from time to time. A treaty with the Vuldrok in 4965 gave the continent of Valdalla to the barbarians as a semi-autonomous fiefdom. As a result, there is a strong Inquisition and Temple Avesti presence, which the Church does little to restrain.
