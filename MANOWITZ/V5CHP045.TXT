Frigate

A frigate is a medium-sized combat vessel, smaller than a capital ship but larger and more heavily armed than a fighter or scout craft. Frigates serve multiple roles in space combat, including escorting larger vessels, patrolling borders, engaging in hit-and-run tactics, and participating in fleet battles.
