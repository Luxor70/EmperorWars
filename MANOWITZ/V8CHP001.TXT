Annunaki

Records show that there was one race, or possibly two, who traveled the heavens long before humanity ever reached the stars. The Anunnaki (or Preadamite) is a term for the alien races of pre-historic times whose technology was of incredibly high advancement. The elder of these races have left behind the massive jumpgates that allow interstellar travel to be possible. The Anunnaki have disappeared and their only legacy is in the mythologies of the Children of the Ur, the technology of their disciples, the remains and ruins of their greatest relics.
