Legion of the Cloak Guard

It is unknown how official this order is, but it is certainly the name given to the true bodyguard of the Decados Prince, which protects him covertly and performs assassinations for him covertly as well. Nobody has ever admitted to being a member of the Legion of the Cloak. What is known for certain is that each Prince has his or her personal corps of assassins as bodyguards, and their identities, numbers, and capabilities are always hidden.

Decados-only unit.
