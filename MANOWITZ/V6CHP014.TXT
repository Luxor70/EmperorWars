 DeMoley

An inhospitable and barren planet, De Moley has little atmosphere (about as much as Mars). Terraforming was incomplete when the Second Republic collapsed. Nonetheless, De Moley is home to the prime Brother Battle monastery. Visitors must negotiate the treacherous paths up the high crags to reach the monastery, since the howling winds are too much for most skimmers to handle. The valleys between the high mountains are calmer, hosting the atmosphere domes in which a small populace lives, helping to reap De Moley's resources. A hard life is all the peasants of De Moley know. Those few who escape from this world are valued for their hardiness.
