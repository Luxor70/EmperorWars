Stealth Tank

Stealth tanks incorporate advanced stealth technology to minimize their visibility on the battlefield. This includes specialized materials, coatings, and designs that reduce their radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures, making them harder to detect by enemy sensors.

Stealth tanks are designed with a low profile and sleek shape to minimize their visual signature. They may also have adaptive camouflage systems that allow them to blend into their surroundings, making them difficult to spot by the naked eye or surveillance systems.

Stealth tanks are equipped with sophisticated sensor countermeasures to deceive and confuse enemy detection systems. These countermeasures may include electronic jamming systems, decoy emitters, or false signatures that make it challenging for the enemy to accurately locate or target the tank.
