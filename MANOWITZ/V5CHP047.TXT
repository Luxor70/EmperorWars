Golden Claw Knights

This honorary knightly order is quite similar to the Hawkwood honorary knighthoods which they copy, but they involve more pageantry and bravado and meet more often simply to counter the fact that they are less longstanding than the corresponding Hawkwood orders. Knights of the Obsidian, Iron, and Golden Claws tend to be more loud about their membership and more demonstrative of their great valor than their Hawkwood counterparts.

Hazat-only unit.
